<b>This content is a version of the guidance on secure disposal of ICT equipment, January 2015.<br/>
This is Legacy IA Policy. It is under review and likely to be withdrawn or substantially revised soon. Please contact us before using this on a new project: <a href="mailto:itpolicycontent@digital.justice.gov.uk?subject=secure-disposal-of-ict-equipment">itpolicycontent@digital.justice.gov.uk</a></b>

Most ICT equipment, such as desktops, laptops and USB sticks used by MOJ, its agencies and arms length bodies is procured and managed though MOJ suppliers who are responsible for the secure disposal of the equipment when it is no longer used. Typically a supplier managed device will have a supplier asset tag on it.

However there are also laptops, desktops, printers, and a large number of CD/DVDs and USB sticks and older storage devices such as floppy disks, across the MOJ estate which have been procured and managed locally. It is crucial that they are disposed of in a secure manner to prevent data being leaked.

Depending on the type of media, its Government Security Classification and what disposal outcome you want to achieve you can use the table below to guide you.  If you cannot find the media, classification or outcome, please contact Operational Security Team.  You should always seek advice for the disposal of SECRET and TOP SECRET assets.

| Title | **Re-use within department** | **Destroy** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flash (USB) | Delete the data and/or erase using manufacturer instructions | Destroy using commercially available disintegration equipment to produce particles of a maximum of 6 mm in any direction. |
| Hard disk drive | Overwrite the entire storage space with random/garbage data, verifying that only the data used to perform the overwrite can be read back  | Break the platters into at least 4 pieces. This can be done either manually or by using a commercially available destruction product suitable for use with hard disks; __OR__ Lower Level degauss, __THEN__ apply a destructive procedure that prevents the disk from turning (e.g. punching, twisting or bending the platters). |
| Magnetic tapes and floppy disks | Overwrite the entire storage space with random/garbage data, verifying that only the data used to perform the overwrite can be read back | Destroy using a commercially available shredder that meets a recognised international destruction standard. Particles of tape should be no larger than 6 x 15 mm; __OR__ Lower Level degauss, __THEN__ cut the tape to no larger than 20 mm in any direction. |
| Optical media | Nil | Shred or disintegrate using equipment that meets a recognised international destruction standard. Particles should be no larger than 6 mm in any direction. |
| Computer monitor | N/A | If  the monitor has an asset tag, it must be returned to ATOS. This can be done by contacting the technology helpdesk on (0800 917 5148). However, if the monitor does not have a tag, you should contact either Data Eliminate or Tier1. |


Owners of the data storage devices are responsible for procuring services that meet the necessary destruction outcomes as described above. Assurance shall be required that the appropriate destruction has taken place for any locally procured ICT assets, and that an audit trail is available for inspection upon request by the IT Security Officer.

Wherever possible and appropriate, managers should pool together equipment with that of local colleagues to share service costs.

If you are based in a London HQ site the Accommodation Team will coordinate bulk secure disposal, please contact them in the first instance.

If you have any concerns about moving items between sites securely please contact ICT Operational Security.

A high capacity CD/DVD shredder is located in 102 Petty France, 5.32, suitable for items up to TOP SECRET. It is recommended that staff located in Petty France and Clive House that need to destroy any CD/DVD should use this machine.
