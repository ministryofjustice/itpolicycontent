## Secure use of removable media

<b>This content is a version of the guidance on removable media, January 2015.<br/>
This is Legacy IA Policy. It is under review and likely to be withdrawn or substantially revised soon. Please contact us before using this on a new project: <a href="mailto:itpolicycontent@digital.justice.gov.uk?subject=removable-media">itpolicycontent@digital.justice.gov.uk</a></b>

This notice is a reminder to anyone using a laptop and any removable storage media for work purposes: these items must be encrypted to MOJ ICT or, where relevant, NOMS ICT security standards.

Security encryption is a mandatory government measure, and one of the most important methods we have to protect MOJ's information.

## What is 'removable' media?

Laptops and BlackBerry are the Department's most  commonly used items of removable media. Removable storage media covers data items such as USB memory sticks, writeable CDs/DVDs, floppy discs and external hard drives.

MOJ ICT security guidance specifies that USB memory sticks and other removable media should not be used to store departmental data. Only in exceptional circumstances, and where there is compelling business justification, should MOJ-approved USB sticks with device encryption be used.

For those individuals who have access to and use NOMS information, PSO 9010, PS0 9015 and PI 03/09 also apply and require USB memory sticks to be encrypted to NOMS ICT security standards.

## USB memory sticks

Since August 2008 there has been national guidance on the use of USB memory sticks and other types of removable data storage media (e.g. CDs).

*   Following occurrences of data loss within other government departments, and in particular lost USB sticks, staff must only connect approved external removable storage media to MOJ desktop or laptop devices.
*   This preventative step will help ensure that MOJ data remains secure and mitigates the potential impact of lost data sticks whilst we review the implementation of our policy and long term approach.
*   Connecting non-approved memory sticks is a breach of MOJ IT Security guidelines, and could result in disciplinary action.
*   If there is a genuine business requirement to save, retrieve or transfer data via removable media, please declare this requirement to Ministry of Justice ICT by completing a business case form and sending it to Operational Security. There is one form for requesting use of a USB memory stick and another called a Data Movement form for all other types of requests.
*   [Removable media business case form](/documents/2015/04/removable-media-business-case-form-for-usb-sticks.doc)
*   [Data Movement form](/documents/2015/04/data-movement-form.doc)
*   [Data Movement form guide](/documents/2015/04/data-movement-form-guide.doc)
*   The requirement will be evaluated by Ministry of Justice ICT Operational Security, with a view to recommending the safest and most appropriate method to contain risk of loss.
*   Please submit requirements by e-mail to Operational Security. We aim to respond within 5 working days
*   Requests for use of a memory stick or other removable media will only be granted when it is not possible to avoid their use. In this event, only approved, encrypted memory sticks or other removable device provided by the department will be allowed. Their use will be subject to stringent conditions and following user training

If you need further assistance or information about this process, please contact Operational Security.

## How do I know if my laptop, or USB stick, is encrypted?

All laptops that have been purchased through the Department's recognised central procurement systems are now encrypted to MOJ IT security standards. These established channels must be used for purchasing any mobile computing device.

## What's expected of you

Keeping MOJ's information safe is everyone's responsibility. Anyone using portable computing equipment must take particular care to safeguard the equipment and the information stored on it.  Failure to do so may result in disciplinary procedures.
