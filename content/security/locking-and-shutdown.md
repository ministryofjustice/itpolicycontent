## General

The Department has made a commitment towards sustainable IT and this is being emphasised in all government departments at present. The intentions are

* to reduce overall power consumption for the department by switching off machines and saving energy;
* reduce the department's overall carbon footprint

### How do I shutdown my desktop computer?

* Close all applications.
* Shut down the computer by clicking the 'Start' button at the bottom left hand corner of the screen. Next, click 'Shut Down'.
* A pop-up box will appear with a drop-down box. Select 'Shut Down' and click 'OK'. After a few seconds your computer will automatically shut down.
* Switch off your monitor screen. The 'off' switch is located in the bottom right-hand corner of your PC Monitor.

### What are the benefits?

By switching off our computers at the end of each working day we are contributing towards being energy efficient and environmentally friendly. We are all responsible for our own Carbon Footprint. So, please switch off your PC monitor along with your desktop computer at the end of each working day. In addition, please switch off any other PC monitors if you notice they too have been left on overnight.

### What if there are any issues preventing you from switching off your computer?

If there are any issues preventing you from switching off your desktop computer overnight, then please raise this with the [IT Service Desk](#contacts) immediately as there could be an underlying fault that needs resolving.

If you require any further information regarding this policy, please contact your local customer service manger.

### Locking your Windows sessions

Access to most computer systems (referred to as 'log in' or 'log on') is controlled by a username and password. The user name identifies the user as a valid user of the system and the password authenticates that the user is who they say they are.

You are responsible for what you do and may be held responsible for any actions carried out using your username and password. You must therefore not allow any one else to do work on any system using your ID and password. If you leave your computer logged on when you are away from it, it may be possible for sensitive information held on the computer system to be used, read, changed, printed or copied by someone not authorised to see it.

If you are leaving your computer unattended for a short period of time **'lock'** your computer by activating your password protected screen saver or any similar 'locking' facility. A simple and quick way to lock your computer is:

__To LOCK__ - press Windows key and L together

__To UNLOCK__ - press Ctrl, Alt and Delete

## Laptops

### Background

Following a data review, a project was set up to have all departmental laptops installed with BeCrypt. This software encrypts the entire contents of a laptop's hard disk drive to prevent any data stored locally from being accessed in the event the laptop is either lost or stolen.

BeCrypt disk encryption software requires you to use a small security token that connects to your laptop and a nine character password, for authentication. The correct procedure is for staff to log in to their laptop and enter the BeCrypt secure password each time the machine is switched on. Following the BeCrypt log on, you are still presented with your normal Windows logon screen where you enter your username and password. The BeCrypt log on process decrypts the laptop's hard drive, which leaves the data vulnerable until the process is reversed and the user fully shuts the laptop down.

### Incident

Investigations into recent security incidents indicate several instances where the correct security procedures are not being followed, with laptops being left logged on overnight.

Information presented to the Operational Security Team indicates some staff are not switching off their laptops on all occasions. Instead, they are keeping their laptops on and using the Control, Alt and Delete keys to lock the machine, so they can subsequently gain access without entering the BeCrypt password.

Please note this __is not good security practice__ and defeats the purpose and objective of installing disc encryption on MOJ laptops. If a device is lost or stolen whilst the machine is in locked mode, the data on the machine is not protected by the BeCrypt software and is vulnerable to a potential security breach.

Leaving the laptop in MOJ premises may not guarantee the equipment's security. Laptop losses do sometimes occur within our offices. As there is a greater risk of data loss when a laptop is left partially logged on overnight, __users should always fully log off the laptop at the end of their working day.__

### What you need to do

* Log on using the BeCrypt token and password on ALL occasions.
* Switch off the machine completely at the end of each usage.
* Keep the BeCrypt token separate from the laptop when not being used.
* Do not attach the password to the machine or keep the password with the machine.

If you need further assistance or information about this process, email Operational Security.
