<b>This guidance applies to all staff and contractors who work for the MOJ.</b>

## What to do if your device is lost, stolen, or compromised

> Note: You can help reduce problems by making sure that devices used for MOJ tasks are always shut down before leaving Government premises. Locking a laptop, or 'putting it to sleep' is not completely secure. A lost or stolen laptop can be accessed more easily if it is only locked or sleeping. A shut down makes sure that all security measures are in place, such as full disk encryption.

If you think your device is lost, stolen, 'hacked', or in some way compromised, you must:

1.  Contact the Technology Service Desk. The analyst will ask the relevant questions and note responses on the ticket. The contact telephone number you need is:<br/>![](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/app/uploads/2017/12/74015bc20bb1c38fb4249c4ef6d3cfed.gif)<br/>&nbsp;<br/>or if calling from overseas:<br/>![](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/app/uploads/2018/05/8fc27c901ed47aa9d7edcb8ff4121e66.gif)<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
2.  Tell your line manager as soon as possible.
3.  For a lost or stolen device, contact the Police and make sure you get the incident reference number.
4.  When back online fill in a [security incident form](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/report-a-security-incident/).
5.  Email the completed form to:<br/>![](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/app/uploads/2017/12/e6404c31d65821489a775401ce4b941d.gif)<br/>&nbsp;<br/>

If MOJ data or information is lost or compromised, [report it as a data loss](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/report-a-security-incident/report-a-data-loss/).
