<b>This policy applies to all staff and contractors who work for the MOJ.</b>

The MOJ provides access to the Intranet and Internet for business use. The access helps you to do your job effectively and efficiently. MOJ security policies governs your use of these facilities.

Reasonable [personal use is allowed](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/acceptable-use/), if:

- your line manager agrees
- it does not interfere with the performance of your duties

You and your manager are responsible for ensuring that you use these systems responsibly.

If you connect to a website that contains unsuitable, illegal or offensive material:

- disconnect from the site immediately
- inform your [Service Desk](#service-desks)

The Department monitors the use of electronic communications and web-browsing activity. If your email use or web browsing seems unacceptable, your manager can request detailed activity reports.

### What websites can I access?

As part of the move to new technology, we are updating the department's approach to website access. By default, we try to allow access to as much as possible of the internet for all users. Inevitably, there are some restrictions, for the following reasons:

- **Cyber security** - the site is an unacceptable security risk for the MOJ systems or users. For example, sites known to host malware
- **Technical** - the site causes technical issues which interfere with business activities. For example, a video site uses too much network capacity
- **Business Policy** - only a specific individual or group of users can access the site. For example, social media sites are blocked for systems or users in frontline roles

The list of websites included in each of the categories is as small as possible. But if you cannot access a site that you think should be OK, you can [request a review](#what-to-do-if-you-are-blocked-from-a-website-that-you-think-should-be-ok). Similarly, if you can access a site that you think should be blocked, [request a review](#what-to-do-if-you-are-able-to-access-a-website-that-you-think-should-be-blocked).

The access rules that apply depend on your system. For users that have been migrated to Microsoft Office 365 (O365), [this document](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/web-browsing-security-policy-profiles-new/) applies. For users that have not been migrated to O365, [this document](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/web-browsing-security-policy-profiles/) applies.

### What to do if you are blocked from a website that you think should be OK

Log an incident with your [Service Desk](#service-desks).

Provide the following details:

- the address of the website
- time you visited the site
- the details of any block message that you received

The Service Desk will investigate the reason why you cannot access the website.

If there was a system error or fault, remedial action will restore access.

If the block is due to an access rule, Operational Security reviews whether to change the rule.
