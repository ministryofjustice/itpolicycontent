## About this document

This document is the MoJ ICT Security Policy. It provides the core set of ICT security principles, expectations, roles and responsibilities for both ICT systems and the usage of them.

The MoJ ICT Security Policy sits at the top of the MoJ ICT Security Policy Framework, Tier 1. Tier 1 and 2 represent the MoJ's fundamental ICT security policies with applicability across all MoJ ICT domains. Tier 2 contains a set of focused ICT security policies which are referenced from this document.

### How to use this document

Each policy statement outlines a security requirement (or set of security requirements) and where applicable, a reference is provided to further material. A unique identifier is associated with each statement for easy reference. The format of each statement is illustrated below:

<table border='1'>
<tr>
<td>POL.ITSEC.XXX:

</tr>
</table>

The policies outlined in this document form the baseline standard. Where exceptions are required, this is captured on a case by case basis in Tier 4, such exceptions requires approval from the Business Group / Area SIRO based on the advice provided by the MoJ ITSO, Accreditor and business group / area IA lead.

## Applicability

### Introduction

The Ministry of Justice's ICT Security Policy supports the MoJ corporate security policy and has the same authority and applicability. The MoJ ICT Security Policy is based on HMG security policies, standards and guidance, as defined within the [HMG Security Policy Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/security-policy-framework).

ICT systems are crucial to delivering MoJ's core business activities effectively. The objective of ICT security is to ensure business continuity and minimise damage by preventing and reducing the impact of ICT security incidents. This policy applies to all MoJ's ICT systems, including those managed by ICT service providers. It covers the use of ICT equipment, the information processed on those ICT systems and documentation about those systems, irrespective of location.

The purpose of this policy and ICT Security Policy Framework as a whole is to:

- Inform users how to safeguard information assets from unauthorised access and modification;
- Describe acceptable use, access and disclosure of information in accordance with policies, regulations, and applicable legislation;
- Allow the MoJ to detect, manage and recover from security incidents with the least disruption to the organisation;
- Ensure MoJ ICT suppliers and service providers comply with the minimum requirements set out in this policy and within the wider security policy framework;
- Ensure that MoJ information and ICT assets are utilised for MoJ business use only, and;
- Enable the MoJ to make best use of its investment in ICT.

### Scope

This policy covers the areas of information security for which MoJ ICT is responsible. Where responsibility is shared with other areas and functions, points of contact and lines of responsibility have been specified.

The elements of the MoJ covered by this policy are; all MoJ business groups, ALBs, Agencies, contractors, ICT suppliers and partners who have access to, or, process MoJ information.

### Approval Process

Approval for this policy and the policy document and artefacts which sit underneath it is provided by the MoJ Cyber Security and Information Assurance with the delegated authority of the MoJ SIRO. Upon approval, a release version is generated and published as part of the MoJ ICT Security Policy Framework.

### Overarching ICT Security Policy

The overarching Ministry of Justice policy states that:

<table border='1'>
<tr>
<td>POL.ITSEC.001:
<br/>
The IT security regime <b>must support</b> the outcomes of <b>the</b> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/security-policy-framework">HMG Security Policy Framework (SPF)</a>;</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.002:
<br/>
All ICT systems <b>must conform</b> to applicable regulatory and legislative requirements;</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.003:
<br/>
All ICT systems <b>must have</b> documented security procedures;</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.004:
<br/>
Any ICT security countermeasures or risk mitigations <b>must be</b> appropriate and proportional to the level of risk posed;</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.005:
<br/>
All ICT systems and the information held on them <b>must be</b> protected against unauthorised access.</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.006:
<br/>
All ICT systems and their users <b>must maintain</b> the confidentiality of information held on those systems and services provided.</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.007:
<br/>
All ICT systems and their users <b>must maintain</b> the integrity of information held on those systems and services provided.</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.008:
<br/>
All ICT systems and their users <b>must maintain</b> the availability of information held on those systems and services provided.</td></tr>
</table>

This policy is supported by policies, standards and guidance in the ICT Security Policy Framework. The rest of this document provides the set of core policies with references to the wider framework where further detail is provided.

#### Privacy and ICT Security

<table border='1'>
<tr>
<td>POL.ITSEC.009:
<br/>
All users of ICT systems <b>must be</b> made aware that the MoJ monitors and audits its ICT systems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>POL.ITSEC.010:
<br/>
MoJ and MoJ ICT service providers <b>must ensure</b> any system monitoring or auditing complies with relevant legislation.</td></tr>
</table>

MoJ may require access to audit logs in investigating incidents (investigations may be of a purely technical nature such as a virus incident, but may also include investigations into malicious behaviour). MoJ will comply with all relevant legislation and MoJ HR policy in its monitoring and auditing activities. As such, the MoJ will exercise its rights to ensure that its computer equipment and systems are used in a legitimate and lawful manner. This applies equally to MoJ ICT service providers.

### Review of security policies

<table border='1'>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.011:
<br/>
MoJ ICT Security Policies <b>must be</b> maintained and reviewed on a regular basis to a schedule determined by the ITSO – This is currently annually for all policies in this policy set.</td></tr>
</table>

The MoJ ICT security policy and any supporting ICT security guides will be reviewed by the ITSO according to the following schedule and criteria:

- Annually;
- Following a serious ICT security incident; and
- In the light of any significant future changes (e.g. relating to major changes in policy or context of operations; modification, replacement or creation of new services or major applications; or recommendations following formal risk analysis reviews).

## Risk Assessment, Management and Audit.

### Risk Assessment and Management

<table border='1'>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.012:
<br/>
All ICT systems <b>must undergo</b> a technical risk assessment. The type of risk assessment and application criteria is available in the <a href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/infrastructure-system-accreditation/">Accreditation Framework</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.013:
<br/>
All ICT systems which process OFFICIAL data <b>must be</b> accredited in accordance with HMG Information Assurance Standards. This could include the production of an RMADS. Advice must be sought from the ITSO for systems processing data at SECRET or TOP SECRET.</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.014:
<br/>
All ICT systems which are subject to the accreditation process <b>must be</b> subject to (at least) an annual technical risk assessment in accordance to <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/information-risk-management-hmg-ia-standard-numbers-1-2">HMG Information Assurance Standard No. 1 &amp; 2</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.015:
<br/>
All risk management decisions <b>must be</b> recorded. For ICT systems undergoing accreditation, risk management decisions <b>must be</b> recorded in the RMADS.</td></tr>
</table>

The Security Policy Framework (SPF) states:

> All ICT systems that manage government information or that are interconnected to them are assessed to identify technical risks. Proportionate assurance processes will provide confidence that these identified risks are being properly managed. This also takes account of risks originating from within the organisations, which could arise from poor behaviours and malicious insiders.

### Business Impact

<table border='1'>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.016:
<br/>
At the direction of the system Accreditor, a Business Impact Assessment <b>must be</b> conducted for all ICT systems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.017:
<br/>
All new ICT systems <b>must be</b> assessed as to whether a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is required.</td></tr>
</table>

As part of the MoJ approach to risk management, the potential impact of a successful attack on the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the asset/s supported or processed by an ICT system is assessed in terms of business impact. The definition of an asset is taken from [HMG Information Assurance Standard No.1 & 2](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/information-risk-management-hmg-ia-standard-numbers-1-2):

> Anything that has value to the organisation, its business operations and its continuity.

In the context of an ICT system, this includes (but not limited to) data, hardware, software and business services provided by the system.

HMG Business Impact Levels should be used as the bases for conducting a business impact assessment. The [MoJ Accreditation Framework](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/infrastructure-system-accreditation/) provides guidance and further information on how to conduct a business impact assessment and guidance on whether a PIA is required.

### Audit

<table border='1'>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.018:
<br/>
Documentary evidence <b>must be</b> made available (upon request) which details the implementation of any technical security control in an ICT system. This includes evidence that any technical security controls are operating correctly and provide the desired risk mitigation as documented in the RMADS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.019:
<br/>
Documentary evidence <b>must be</b> maintained to catalogue all changes (including configuration changes) to ICT systems and the ICT security implications of those changes (this includes the case where no significant ICT security impact are identified).</td></tr>
</table>

MoJ ICT IA is responsible for reviewing all RMADS submissions before system accreditation is considered. It is the responsibility of the ICT service provider/s and ICT system manager/s to ensure that an RMADS document is generated, factually correct, complete and includes all the information required for an accreditation decision to be made. This includes details of any risk mitigating controls and residual risks.

The Accreditor (or delegate) may require further information, clarification or further documentary evidence regarding the submitted RMADS.

## Roles and Responsibilities

The foundation of good Information Security is the establishment and operation of an effective Information Security Management System (ISMS). Establishing an effective ISMS involves clearly defining the security management structure and the roles and responsibilities which sit within it.

### ICT security management structure

<table border='1'>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.020:
<br/>
All MoJ ICT Users <b>must be</b> made aware of their role/s and responsibilities for IT security.</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.021:
The mandatory set of ICT security roles which <b>must be</b> fulfilled is detailed in this policy, see <a href="#ict-security-role-and-responsibility-definition">here</a>.</td></tr>
</table>

The ICT security management structure falls within the overall MoJ security management structure.

The Permanent Secretary, as Accounting Officer, has overall responsibility for all aspects of security. The Senior Security Advisor (SSA) and MoJ SIRO support the Permanent Secretary by providing advice on personal, physical and information security policy and procedure. The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) supports the SSA by providing advice on ICT security policy. This structure is depicted in Figure 2.

Figure 2 - ICT security management structure

**Note:** A particular individual role, for example Senior Information Risk Owner, may be shared across a number of ICT Systems.

<a id="ict-security-role-and-responsibility-definition"></a>

### ICT security role and responsibility definition

<table border='1'>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.022:
<br/>
For each ICT system, a named individual <b>must be</b> associated to each of the ICT security roles defined in this policy (those defined in this section) and appropriately documented. For system undergoing the accreditation process, this should be documented in the RMADS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.023:
<br/>
Those who have been assigned an ICT security role for a particular ICT system <b>must be</b> made aware of their responsibilities.</td></tr>
</table>

#### Senior Information Risk Owners

The MoJ's Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) is responsible for the crossMoJ information risk policy and guidance and ensuring it continues to provide a suitable risk framework.

MoJ Business Group/Area SIROs are responsible for implementing and managing information risk in their respective business groups and, reviewing the application of policy and guidance regularly thereafter to ensure it remains appropriate to their business objectives and risk environment.

Also, MoJ Business Group/Area SIROs are responsible for authorising any exceptions and deviations from the ICT Security Policy.

####  Information Asset Owners

Information Asset Owners must be satisfied that all required technical, personnel, physical and procedural security controls are in place, adhered to and where appropriate, raising risks to the SIRO (An IAO obtains the ICT assurance from the ICT IA team via the Accreditation process).

The IAO needs to understand what information is held, what is added and what is removed, how information is moved, and who has access and why. As a result they are able to understand and address risks to the information and ensure that information they are responsible for is fully used within applicable legislation and provide written input to the SIRO annually on the security and use of their asset.

#### ICT System Managers

It is the responsibility of the local ICT System Manager to ensure that all ICT security incidents are reported. The ICT System Manager may provide ICT security advice to end Users based upon the MoJ ICT Security Policy Framework and security documentation for that ICT system or refer them to the MoJ Operational Security Team.

#### Line Managers

Line managers are responsible for ensuring that:

- New recruits/contractors have had the required recruitment or national security vetting checks before being granted ICT system access;
- All their staff, including agency staff and contractors, receive appropriate induction and training covering the use of MoJ ICT equipment;
- All their staff, including agency staff and contractors, are aware of the ICT Security Policy and adhere to it;
- All their staff, including agency staff and contractors, have access to user guides for the computer systems and applications they use;
- All their staff, including agency staff and contractors, have access to a copy of the ICT Security Guide and any other ICT security policies, standards and guides relevant to their work; and
- The resources needed for ICT security within their business area are provided.

When a member of staff is known to be leaving, line managers have specific responsibilities. The manager is responsible for ensuring:

- The leaver's checklist is completed;
- Any official ICT equipment is returned to the Department;
- Access to ICT-based systems is removed; and
- The appropriate handover of electronic data such as emails and files which may be required for business continuity – such data should be saved in a controlled but accessible location so that information can be accessed when required (for example on a shared drive).

It is the responsibility of the manager and the member of staff who is leaving to make certain, before the last working day, that all records which require access and retention from email accounts, and any other electronic records, are moved to a storage area that is easily accessible. For areas of MoJ with access, this should be TRIM; for other areas a shared drive would be suitable. In such cases, the sensitivity of this information must be taken into account and care should be taken to ensure the location is only accessible by those with a need to know. Accounts must not remain open after staff have left the MoJ.

If the individual has left without notice, the leaving employee's activities will need to be undertaken by the line manager.

#### Individual ICT user

All MoJ ICT users are responsible for all actions carried out on a computer under their 'user account' and for any computer equipment in their charge. All MoJ ICT users must:

- Familiarise themselves with the contents of the ICT Security Guide;
- Comply with applicable Security Operating Procedures (SyOPs);
- Obtain further advice from the ICT Service Desk if necessary;
- Keep computer user account passwords secure;
- Protect all ICT equipment in their custody; and
- Report all actual and suspected ICT security incidents through the ICT Service Desk or relevant incident reporting process defined within their business area.

The leaving employee is responsible for:

- Working with the manager to follow the leaver's checklist, completing any tasks and returning any items in good time;
- Ensuring the leaver's (non work related) personal data is deleted; and
- Placing an Out of Office Message on the account providing details of an appropriate alternative contact.

#### MoJ ICT service providers

ICT service providers are responsible for ensuring that their staff and subcontractors adhere to MoJ's ICT security policy, and that they deliver the security controls required for the systems they provide and manage.

## Identification and Authentication Controls

<table border='1'>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.024:
<br/>
All ICT systems <b>must implement</b> appropriate controls, in relation to the risks identified, to identify users, authenticate their actions, control their access to system services and data, and revoke access to system services and data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.025:
<br/>
Authorised access to the ICT systems, the services they provide and information held on them <b>must be</b> made available on a need-to-know basis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.026:
<br/>
Where users are provided with access credentials to confirm their identity and authenticate themselves (e.g. a password token), they <b>must ensure</b> that they do not divulge those credentials and report (as a security incident) any incidents where access credentials have or may have been compromised or lost.</td></tr>
</table>

Identification, authentication and authorisation security controls are implemented by both technical controls within the ICT system and by procedural controls which are followed by users and administrators of that ICT System.

Where these security controls are implemented within the ICT system, the [ICT Security – Technical Controls Policy](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/technical-controls-policy/) provides further detail on the MoJ policy in this area.

For procedural controls, the [ICT Security - Acceptable Use Policy](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/it-acceptable-use-policy/) provides details on the MoJ policy with regards to the usage of ICT systems.

## Technical Controls and Codes of Connection

<table border='1'>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.027:
<br/>
The implementation of all ICT systems <b>must consider</b> technical security controls with respect to the <a href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/technical-controls-policy/">ICT Security - Technical Controls Policy</a> for any risks identified through the business impact assessment and/or accreditation process. This is subject to any risk management decisions taken as part of the accreditation process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.028:
<br/>
Where a MoJ ICT system shares services and/or data with; a) another system in different MOJ ICT business domain, b) another government department and/or c) a third party, technical Codes of Connection <b>must be</b> established and agreed with the relevant parties which include (but are not limited to): system Accreditor, ITSO, IAO and information sharing parties. Further details provided in <a href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/it-acceptable-use-policy/">ICT Security – Acceptable Use Policy</a></td></tr>
</table>

## ICT Security Incident Management

Incident Management is the ability to react to different types of security incidents in a controlled, pre-planned manner. Preparation and planning are key factors to successful information security management and it is important that ICT security incident management is considered for every MoJ ICT system.

Forensic investigation is a component of incident management and allows the MoJ to respond to security incidents which require the collection, storage, analysis and preparation of digital evidence that may be required in legal or disciplinary proceedings.

<table border='1'>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.029:
<br/>
All MoJ ICT domains <b>must have</b> an IT Security Incident Management Plan which conforms to the <a href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/it-incident-management-policy/">ICT Security – IT Incident Management Policy</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.030:
<br/>
All ICT Security Incidents <b>must be</b> reported in accordance with the relevant IT Security Incident Management Plan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.031:
<br/>
All ICT systems <b>must make</b> provision for ICT Security incident management (including identifying budget lines which could be used to manage an incident) with reference to the MoJ ICT Security Management Plan. This provision must be documented and included as part of system accreditation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.032:
<br/>
All ICT systems <b>must consider</b> the collection of digital evidence as part of a forensic investigation in system design and operation where applicable, this in accordance to the <a href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/moj-forensic-readiness-policy/">ICT Security – Forensic Readiness Policy</a></td></tr>
</table>

## Use of Cryptography

Some ICT systems at the MoJ make use of HMG supplied cryptographic material. These systems are generally those which provide functionality to connect to 3rd party systems or protect information at rest on mobile devices (e.g. laptops).

<table border='1'>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.033:
<br/>
All ICT systems which require cryptographic controls <b>must conform</b> to Information Assurance Standard No. 4 [Issue 5.2, Nov 2012].</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.034:
<br/>
There are strict controls around the use of this material. Any use of HMG cryptographic material or products <b>must conform</b> to the <a href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/use-of-hmg-cryptography-policy/">MoJ ICT Security – Use of HMG Cryptography Policy</a>.</td></tr>
</table>

**Note:** Information Assurance Standard No. 4 [Issue 5.2, Nov 2012] states that if HMG cryptographic material is handled, Departments and Agencies must appoint a Communications Security Officer (COMSO). The COMSO is responsible to the SIRO and DSO for ensuring the MoJ's compliance with the minimum HMG Comsec and cryptography requirements, and developing, implementing and maintaining organisational communications. For further details on the use of HMG cryptographic material can be found in the [MoJ ICT Security – Use of HMG Cryptography Policy](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/use-of-hmg-cryptography-policy/).

## Remote Working and Mobile Computing

Remote working means any working away from the office, whether from home, another MoJ or government office, whilst travelling, at conferences, in hotels, etc, while using ICT equipment to access and connect to ICT systems and services.

Mobile computing is the use of portable computing equipment. Remote working will usually involve the use of portable computing equipment, usually a laptop computer and personal electronic devices (PEDs), such as tablets, Blackberry devices, functionally rich smart phones. Such devices may include functionality such as, digital cameras, voice recorders etc as well as email, web browsing and other computing capabilities.

<table border='1'>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.035:
<br/>
All Users who use remote working and/or mobile computing <b>must be</b> aware of the security operating procedures which <b>must be</b> followed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.036:
<br/>
Mobile Computing equipment provided by the MoJ <b>must only</b> be used for authorised purposes and must be returned to the MoJ upon request by a line manager, or, when the user in receipt of the equipment leaves the MoJ or has no further remote working requirement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.037:
<br/>
Any request to take MoJ ICT equipment abroad <b>must be</b> authorised prior to being taken abroad. This authorisation <b>must be</b> provided by a member of the Senior Civil Service (SCS) or equivalent where approval is required from MoJ Corporate Security and MoJ ICT IA. Further details provided in <a href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/it-acceptable-use-policy/">ICT Security – Acceptable Use Policy</a>.</td></tr>
</table>

## Procurement, Development, and Maintenance

For the MoJ IA strategy to be effective, it must be extended to organisations working on behalf of the MoJ, or handling MoJ assets such as contractors, offshore or nearshore managed service providers and suppliers of ICT systems.

<table border='1'>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.038:
<br/>
When the MoJ buys ICT goods, services, systems or equipment, ICT security implications <b>must be</b> considered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.039:
<br/>
All MoJ ICT suppliers who handle and store data on behalf of the MoJ <b>must</b>, on an annual basis, be formally assessed against the HMG Security Policy Framework and MoJ ICT Security Policy. MoJ ICT suppliers are responsible for undertaking this assessment.</td></tr>
</table>

## Asset Disposal

All ICT assets (e.g. computers, laptop and removable media), must be appropriately disposed off to ensure MoJ data is not compromised when ICT assets are either redeployed or decommissioned.

<table border='1'>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.040:
<br/>
All electronic media used to store OFFICIAL data <b>must be</b> securely deleted before being re-used or disposed of, or securely destroyed where re-use is not possible or required. This <b>must be</b> in accordance with <a href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/technical-controls-policy/">ICT Security – Technical Controls Policy</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.041:
<br/>
Unless otherwise specified by MoJ ICT IA, all electronic media <b>must be</b> disposed of in accordance with HMG Information Assurance Standard No.5 [Issue 4.0, April 2011].</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.042:
<br/>
All ICT systems <b>must have</b> a documented asset disposal procedure.</td></tr>
</table>

Further information on asset disposal, in particular the procedural controls are provided in [ICT Security - Acceptable Use Policy](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/it-acceptable-use-policy/).

## Business Continuity

MoJ business groups are required to maintain Business Continuity Plans (BCPs) to ensure the prompt and efficient recovery of key business activities in the event of a disaster or other disruption affecting its premises or assets (including both staff and information).

As ICT systems support the majority of MoJ business activities, business continuity needs to be considered in their design and operation. Business continuity itself in ICT is split between ICT Incident Management and ICT Disaster Recovery.

<table border='1'>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.043:
<br/>
All MoJ Systems <b>must have</b> an ICT Disaster Recovery Plan. This plan must conform to the <a href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/it-disaster-recovery-policy/">ICT Security – ICT Disaster Recovery Policy</a>.</td></tr>
</table>

Further details can be found in the [ICT Incident Management Policy](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/it-incident-management-policy/) and [ICT Disaster Recovery Policy](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/it-disaster-recovery-policy/).

## Physical and Environment

MoJ ICT is not directly responsible for the physical security and environment of MoJ sites. However, physical security controls and the environment in which MoJ ICT systems operate form part of a systems overall risk landscape which is considered during the accreditation process.

<table border='1'>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.044:
<br/>
The physical security controls required to maintain the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of an ICT system <b>must be</b> considered.</td></tr>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.045
<br/>
The environmental risks (e.g. flood or fire) to an ICT system and services <b>must be</b> considered in order to maintain its Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.</td></tr>
</table>

Further information is available from [MoJ Group Security](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/).

## Personnel Security

MoJ ICT is not directly responsible for personnel security; this is the responsibility of MoJ Group Security. This includes aspects such as employee (including contractors and agency staff) joining, moving and leaving, and, assessment of security clearance levels.

However, the security controls associated with personnel form part of the risk assessment of an ICT system and may lead to addition controls being required.

Line managers are responsible for personnel security (of their staff/contractors), including starting, ongoing, and leaver arrangements, under a policy framework set by MoJ HR (recruitment and exit policies) and Corporate Security (National Security Vetting).

<table border='1'>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.046:
<br/>
All ICT systems <b>must consider</b> the personnel security controls (for example, security clearance) required in addition to ICT security controls. These should be recorded in a Security Aspects Letter (SAL) provided by the MoJ.</td></tr>
</table>

Further information is available from [MoJ Group Security](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/).

## Staff Education, Training and Awareness

The MoJ Information Security Education and Awareness strategy is to ensure that users are provided with the necessary training to assist the MoJ in meeting its security objectives of:

- Preventing security breaches and any resulting loss of Confidentiality, Availability or Integrity of information, or in confidence in the Ministry of Justice as a secure organisation; and
- Minimising the disruption caused by actual breaches/incidents.

<table border='1'>
<tr><td>POL.ITSEC.047:
<br/>
All MoJ ICT users (including contractors, agency staff and consultants) <b>must be made aware of, understand and adhere to</b> MoJ ICT Security Policies and security operating procedures as defined in <a href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/it-acceptable-use-policy/">ICT Security – Acceptable Use Policy</a>.</td></tr>
</table>

**Note:** The MoJ Information Security Education and Awareness strategy is the responsibility of the Corporate Security and Business Continuity Branch. The Central IA Branch leads on Information Assurance training; Corporate Security provides training for security liaison officers in HQ and ALBs which includes aspects of physical, personnel and information security.

Further details are available on the MoJ Intranet: <https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/knowledge-information/protecting-information/information-security/>

## ITSO Terms of Reference

The MoJ IT Security officer (ITSO) is responsible for ICT security within MoJ. The ITSO is responsible for maintaining this policy (and ICT Security Policy Framework) and providing advice and guidance on its implementation.
