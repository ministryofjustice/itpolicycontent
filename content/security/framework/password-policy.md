All MOJ systems must comply with the [MOJ Security Policy Framework](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/). To address the requirement, [these statements](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/technical-controls-policy/#user-password-management) from the overall MOJ [Technical Controls Policy](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/technical-controls-policy/) apply:

Policy | Statement
---|---
POL.TCP.044 | The requirement for an ICT system to be protected by a password **must be** derived from a technical risk assessment (using [HMG Information Assurance Standard No. 1 & 2](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/information-risk-management-hmg-ia-standard-numbers-1-2) for systems undergoing the accreditation process) and a Business Impact Assessment (BIA).
POL.TCP.045 | The standard on password generation, composition and management is contained within [ICT Security - Password Standard](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/password-standard/). All IT systems which use passwords for access control **must follow** this standard.
POL.TCP.046 | All supplier or vendor supplied passwords **must be** changed before live operation.
POL.TCP.047 | All ICT systems **must have** a process to change any passwords which might have been compromised.

Though passwords are the primary method of User authentication, other technologies for User identification and authentication, such as biometrics and hardware tokens should be considered where appropriate.
